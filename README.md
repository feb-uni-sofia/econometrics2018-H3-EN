## Homework 3

### Requirements

- Make sure that your code runs _without errors_. Solutions that throw errors will receive 0 points.
- Make sure that your code runs without errors in a clean session to avoid failures when your code is executed on another machine. In R-Studio open Session, select Clear Workspace. Run all your code in one go and look in the R console for errors.
- Only submit relevant code and comments. Superfluous code/comments will lead to score reduction.
- Make sure taht you submit _readable_ code. If in doubt, follow the [tidyverse style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/syntax.html). Hard to read code will lead to a score reduction. You can ignore (2.1 Object names ) of the style guide.
- Before submitting, select all text in the file (in R Studio), open the Code menu and select Reformat Code.
- Do not submit code that executes install.packages. If you need to install the packages, comment the line with install.packages before submitting.
- Remove lines that print objects before submitting, unless explicitly required.
